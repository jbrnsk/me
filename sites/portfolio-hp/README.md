# henry.proctor 

‚úàÔ∏è I built this portfolio site for Henry after we worked together at PorchPass and were both impacted by layoffs. He generously let me build this as a creative outlet and way to keep my frontend / design chops sharp.

#

**Built with:**
- Vue 3 + Vue Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Iconify icons
- Designed from scratch ‚Äî no UI kits or CMS

**Hosted with:**
- AWS S3 + CloudFront (static hosting)
- Route53 (DNS)
