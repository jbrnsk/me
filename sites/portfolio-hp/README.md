# henry.proctor

A personal portfolio site I built for Henry Proctor IV after we worked together at PorchPass and were both impacted by layoffs. He generously let me build this for him as a creative outlet and way to keep my frontend / design chops sharp.

Built with:
- Vue 3 + Vue Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Iconify icons
- Designed from scratch â€” no UI kits or CMS
