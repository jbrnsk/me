# me

This is my personal monorepo, which contains the code deployed at [josephbaranoski.com](https://josephbaranoski.com).

It includes:
- ðŸ•¹ My portfolio site (Vue 3, Tailwind)
- ðŸ›  Experimental tools and projects
- ðŸ§ª Code prototypes and side work

This repo evolves over time and is not tied to any external project.
