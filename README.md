# me

This is my personal monorepo, which contains the code deployed at [josephbaranoski.com](https://josephbaranoski.com).

It includes:
- 🕹 **Portfolio site** (Vue 3, Tailwind)
- 🛠 **Experimental tools and projects**
- 🧪 **Code prototypes and side work**

This repo evolves over time and is not tied to any external project.
